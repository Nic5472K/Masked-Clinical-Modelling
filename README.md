# Masked-Clinical-Modelling
Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM) is a framework for synthetic and augmented survival data generation. Inspired by masked language modeling, MCM preserves hazard ratios to ensure clinical utility, improves discrimination and calibration in Cox models, and supports secure, utility-focused data sharing.
